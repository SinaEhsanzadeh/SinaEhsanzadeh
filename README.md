## Hello

I'm an amatuer programmer that's majoring in CS.

I'm currently learning Unity, and by proxy, C#.

I've had experience working with C and Java before, and also HTML/CSS.

I am currently working on trying to develop a videogame, though I'm unsure of how far it'll go (You can check it out here [here](https://github.com/SinaEhsanzadeh/Trainventure))

I have a long way to go, so any advice and help on any active projects will be highly appreciated!

(And even this README, I am sure this is not visually appealing at *all*)
